# Chapter 1: Introduction to the Communication Module

## 1.1 Context and Background

Modern education institutions face significant challenges in communication, governance, and
progress tracking. Traditional systems often lack the scalability and real-time capabilities
required to manage large user bases. This project aims to solve these issues through an
integrated communication module using **Angular (frontend)** and **Python (backend)**.
**Key Challenges Addressed:**

1. **Fragmented Communication** : Existing systems rely on separate tools for email, SMS,
    and video conferencing, leading to inefficiencies.
2. **Data Overload** : Faculty and administrators need centralized dashboards to make sense
    of large data volumes.
3. **Lack of Real-Time Insights** : Delays in hazard notifications or progress updates can
    impact decision-making.
4. **Guest Access Management** : Enabling secure, temporary access for external users
    (e.g., guest lecturers, industry experts) is often overlooked in legacy systems.

## 1.2 Project Objectives

1. **Seamless Multi-Channel Communication** :
    ○ **SMS, Email, WebSocket (real-time messaging), and WebRTC (audio/video)**
       integration.
    ○ Guests can participate in discussions or webinars without full account creation.
2. **Comprehensive Dashboards** :
    ○ **Centralized Insights** : Tailored for administrators, faculty, students, and guests.
    ○ Guest dashboards will provide limited but essential information, such as session
       schedules and access to materials.
3. **Proactive Hazard Management** :
    ○ Real-time alerts for system anomalies or compliance breaches.
    ○ Guest users receive alerts relevant to their access scope (e.g., webinar
       reminders).

## 1.3 Benefits for Stakeholders

1. **Super Admins** :
    ○ Monitor system health and ensure compliance.
    ○ Manage guest access permissions and track their activity for security and audit
       purposes.
2. **Heads/Deans** :


```
○ Oversee faculty and guest performance, student progress, and risk management.
○ Enable seamless guest participation for special lectures or events.
```
3. **Faculty** :
    ○ Streamline communication with students and guests.
    ○ Track student performance and engagement metrics.
4. **Students** :
    ○ Access personalized dashboards with performance data and notifications.
    ○ Interact with guest lecturers and access recorded sessions or materials.
5. **Guests** :
    ○ Participate in webinars or workshops with temporary credentials.
    ○ Receive relevant notifications and access materials based on their role.
